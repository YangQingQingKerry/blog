            <blockquote>
<p>Quality is never an accident; it is always the result of high intention, sincere effort, intelligent direction and skillful execution â€” William A.Foster </p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Transaction-Cost-Models"><a href="#Transaction-Cost-Models" class="headerlink" title="Transaction Cost Models"></a>Transaction Cost Models</h2><p>The idea behind transaction cost models is that it costs money to trade. In the world of quant trading, there are only two reasons to make a trade: i) It improves the odds or magnitude of making money; ii) It reduces the odds or magnitude of losing money.  The transaction cost models are not designed to minimize the cost of trading, only to inform the portfolio construction engine of the costs of making any given trade. The part of the black box that minimizes costs is the execution algorithm. Transaction costs have three major components: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Commissions and Fees<br>Slippage<br>Market Impact </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Commissions and Fees</strong> Commissions are not the only costs charged by brokerage and exchanges. Brokers charge fees (which are usually a component of the commissions) for services known as <em>clearning</em> and <em>settlement</em>. Clearing involves regulatory reporting and monitoring, tax handling, and handling failure, all of which are activities that must take place in advance of settlement.  Settlement is the delivery of securities in exchange for payment in full, which is the final step in the life of a trading transaction and fulfills the obligations of both parties involved in the transaction. </p>
<p><strong>Slippage</strong> Slippage is the change in the price between the time a trader (or quant system) decides to transact and the time when the order is actually at the exchange for execution. The market is constantly moving, but a trading decision is made as of a specific point in time. As time passes between the decision being made and the trade being executed, the instrument being forecast is likely to be moving away from the price at which it was quoted when the forecast was made. In fact, the more accurate the forecast, the more likely it is that the price of the instrument is actually going toward the expected price as more time passes. But the instrument makes this move without the trader benefiting, because he has not yet gotten his trade to market. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Strategies that tend to suffer most from slippage are those that pursue trend-following strategies, because they are seeking to buy and sell instruments that are already moving in the desired direction. Strategies that tend to suffer least from slippage, and for which slippage can sometimes be a positive, are those that are mean reverting in orientation, because these strategies are usually trying to buy and sell instruments that are moving against them when the order is placed. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Slippage is a function of time, which depends on the traderâ€™s latency or speed to market, the prevailing trend and the volatility of the instrument being forecast. Slippage is not a major factor for instuments with low-volatility, however, it can be a major issue for the ones with high-volatility. </p>
<p><strong>Market Impact</strong> Market impact is a measurement of how much a given order moves the market by its demand for liquidity.  Market impact is normally defined as the difference between the price at the time a market order enters the exchange and the price at which the trade is actually executed. Factors that affect market impact include </p>
<ul>
<li>Size of the order relative to the liquidity present at the time</li>
<li>Imbalance between supply and demand for the instrument being executed </li>
<li>The number of order trades that are being made in the same direction at the same time</li>
<li>Whether news in the stock is causing impact to behave differently from normal</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions like <em>Did a quant traderâ€™s sell order slow the rise of the prevailing trend somewhat, and if so, by how much?</em> need to be answered when building transaction cost models. </p>
<h3 id="Types-of-Transaction-Cost-Models"><a href="#Types-of-Transaction-Cost-Models" class="headerlink" title="Types of Transaction Cost Models"></a>Types of Transaction Cost Models</h3><p>There are four basic types of transaction cost models:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>flat<br>linear<br>piecewise-linear<br>quadratic </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Regardless of the type of model used, the quant must describe the cost of trading each instrument in her universe. After all, a less liquid small cap stock is likely to be more expensive to trade than a more liquid mega cap stock, and that must be a factor in deciding how much of each to trade. Furthermore, the quant should refresh empirical estimations of transaction costs both to keep the model current with the prevailing market conditions as well as to indicate when more research is required to improve the model itself. </p>
<h2 id="Execution"><a href="#Execution" class="headerlink" title="Execution"></a>Execution</h2><p>There are two basic ways to execute a trade: either electronically or through a human intermediary (e.g., a broker). Electronic execution is accomplished through <em>direct market access</em> (DMA), which allows traders to utilize the infrastructure and exchange connectivity of their brokerage firms to trade directly on electronic markets such as <em>electronic communication networks</em> (ECNs).  Traders could call their brokers to work their ordersâ€”pick the best times, sizes, and prices, or occasionally contacting other counterparties to negotiate a better price on a large block trade, or acquire execution algorithms to work on them. Execution algorithms contain the logic used to get an order completed, including instructions about how to slice up an order into smaller pieces (to minimize market impact), or how to respond to various kinds of changes in the limit order book and price behavior. One can acquire execution algorithms in one of the three ways: built them, use the brokerâ€™s, or use a third-party software vendorâ€™s. </p>
<h3 id="Order-Execution-Algorithms"><a href="#Order-Execution-Algorithms" class="headerlink" title="Order Execution Algorithms"></a>Order Execution Algorithms</h3><p>Order execution algorithms determine the way in which systematic execution of a portfolio is actually done. The principle goal of execution algorithms, and the function of most execution desks in general, is to get the desired amount of a trade done as completely as possible and as cheaply as possible.  Cheapness has several facets, including market impact and slippage. One driver of both impact and slippage is what is known as a footprint, which refers to a detectable pattern of behavior by a market participant. If an order execution algorithm leaves an obvious footprint, its activities become predictable to other market participants, and these other participants may well react in such a way as to increase the market impact and slippage incurred by such an algorithm.   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Benchmark: VWAP<br><strong>VWAP</strong>: The most standard benchmark for judging the quality of an execution algorithm over multiple trades.<br><strong>Idea</strong>:  VWAP may give a fair sense of how  the dayâ€™s volumes were priced.<br><strong>Trouble</strong>: Some investors may be fooled by looking at VWAP. If a buyer of stock executes huge volumes during some days, his volumes will most likely increase the price of that stock, and the VWAP. As such, his own activities impact the benchmark against which his execution algorithm is measured,  making the interpretation of this benchmark tricky. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The major considerations that go into the making of an order working algorithm are as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether to be aggressive or passive<br>What type of order to utilize<br>How to determine the ideal order size<br>Where to sent it</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Aggressive versus Passive</strong>  The level of aggressiveness is usually a function of the type of strategy being employed and depends on the strength of the signal, the systemâ€™s confidence in that signal, and sometimes also on considerations from the order book, such as order imbalance. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Strategies</strong><br>It is generally ture that alpha strategies that are based on a concept of momentum will be paired with execution strategies that are more aggressive, because the market can tend to run away from the trader if he is not aggressive. It is also generally the case that mean reversion strategies utilize more passive execution strategies because they are taking the risk that the prevailing trend persists, and at least by executing at a better price, this mitigates the downside risk of standing in front of the steamroller. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Signal</strong><br>If you had inside information that a stock was going to double in the next day because some other company was set to announce an acquisition of the stock in question at a large premium, and if trading on inside information was legal (which of couse is not), you should be perfectly happy to pay a lot of money to the marketplace to fill a large order to buy this stock. It would be illogical to fret over a few pennies per share when many dollars are the upside. On the other hand, if you have no view on a stock but were being asked what youâ€™d be willing to pay for it by someone who wants to sell it, you are likely to offer a low enough price that there is some margin of safety. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Order Types</strong> </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hidden order</strong>: 
Hidden orders are a way to mask oneâ€™s limit orders from the market, at the cost of losing priority versus visible orders at the same price. Placing a hidden order provides no information to the market, which helps reduce the marketâ€™s perception of imbalances. One algorithmic trading technique that utilizes hidden orders is known as iceberging. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Market-on-Close order</strong><br>Release the order as a market order during the closing auction for that day.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Stop limit order</strong><br>Enter a limit order at a predetermined price, but to wait until the instrument trades at that price before entering the order.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Good-till-canceled order</strong><br>A limit order that is not automatically canceled at the end of the day but remains in effect for days or weeks, until explicitly canceled by the trader. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> <strong>Large Order versus Small Order</strong> How much of a total order to send at once? By spreading the order out over time, the trader runs the risk that the price may move more while the order is being spreading out than it would have if it had been executed right away, even with the extra cost of market impact.  Generally, however, it is agreed that spreading out trades is a useful way to reduce the cost if transacting, and this is an extremely common feature in execution algorithms. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The determination of the size of each order is related to the analysis of the correct level of aggressiveness. Again, a highly attractive trade warrants taking on more of it quickly than a trade that is relatively less appealing. But if not, this much aggressiveness in the order placement might not be necessary, and the transaction can be executed in a different manner. For example, a trader might find that taking whatever liquidity is available at the best offer and then waiting for others to step in and offer the same price a moment later could allow the same volume of shares to be acquired at whatever the best offer was at the time that  the first piece of the order was executed, rather than a worse average price achieved by sweeoing through multiple levels of the order book. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> <strong>Where to Send an Order</strong> In some markets, there are several pools of liquidity for the same instruments. There is a whole field of work in the area of <em>smart order routing</em>, which involves determining to which pool of liquidity it is best to send a given order at the current moment.   </p>
<h3 id="Dark-Pools"><a href="#Dark-Pools" class="headerlink" title="Dark Pools"></a>Dark Pools</h3><p> Exchanges can be categorized as being <em>lit</em> and <em>dark</em>. Lit exchanges show market participants the prices and sizes of bids and offers available in the limit order book. Dark exchanges provide no such information. The most relevant feature of a dark pool is that it facilitates the execution of large orders, because orders placed on a dark pool are note revealed.  Dark pools are created by brokers or independent firms to allow <strong>their customers</strong> to trade directly with each other in an anonymous way.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>One a dark pool, there is no information provided about the limti order book, which contains all the liquidity being provided by market makers and other participants. Customers are simply posting their orders to the pool and if someone happens to want to do the opposite side of those orders, the orders get filled. As a result of this anonymous process of matching orders, the market is less likely to move as much as it would in a more public venue, where automated market making practitioners require compensation to take the other side of large orders. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> One fact that makes dark pool transactions somewhat unusual is that they are over-the-counter, off-exchange transactions in instruments that are exchanged traded. Dark pools could not exist without the public markets, because the securities traded on dark pools are listed on public exchanges. Furthermore, the public markets provide the only transparent sense of price discovery, without which dark pool participants would have a significantly harder time determining what prices to bid and offer.  Partly because of these issues, coupled with the fact dark pools are available only to selected customers, controversy surrounds dark pools. </p>
<h2 id="Trading-Infrastructure"><a href="#Trading-Infrastructure" class="headerlink" title="Trading Infrastructure"></a>Trading Infrastructure</h2><p> To execute and process electronic trades, connectivity needs to be set up between the trader and the exchange. Furthermore, a protocol for messages between these two parties is required. The handware and software quants utilize in implementing their trading strategies are the final pieces of infrastructure.  As in most things, quants face a choice between building or buying infrastructure in all three of these areas.  Due to regulatory and other constraints, most traders utilize the services of independent brokerage firms that act as the trading agents for their strategies. One of the benefits of using a broker is that infrastructure requirements are handled by that broker, and this infrastructure can be costly to replicate. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>DMA</strong>: causes between 10 and 30 milliseconds of delay between the time the order is sent from the quantâ€™s server and the time the order reaches the exchange.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Colocation</strong>: have an order travel from the quantâ€™s server to the exchange in a fraction of a millisecond. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p> <strong>Financial Information sEchange (FIX)</strong>: a standardized way for various participants in the trading process to communicate information. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hardware &amp; Software</strong>: attempt to make their algorithms, databases, and execution software leaner, to reduce the internal latency of processing market data and sending an order out to the market. </p>

            <blockquote>
<p>No sensible decision can be made any longer without taking into account not only the world as it is, but the world as it will be â€” Isaac Asimov</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quantitative portfolio construction models come in two major forms. The first family is rule based. The second family is optimized.  Rule-based portfolio construction models are based on heuristics defined by the quant trader and can be exceedingly simple or rather complex. The heuristics that are used are generally rules that are derived from human experience, such as by trial and error. Optimizers utilize algorithms - step-by-step sets of rules designed to get the user from a starting point to a desired ending point - to seek the best way to reach a goal that the quant defines. This goal is known as an <em>objective function</em>, and canonical example of an objective function for an optimizer is to seek the portfolio that generates the highest possible return for a unit of risk. </p>
<h2 id="Rule-Based-Portfolio-Construction-Models"><a href="#Rule-Based-Portfolio-Construction-Models" class="headerlink" title="Rule-Based Portfolio Construction Models"></a>Rule-Based Portfolio Construction Models</h2><p>There are four common types of rule-based portfolio construction models:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>equal position weighting<br>equal risk weighting<br>alpha-driven weighting<br>decision-tree weighting </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Equal Position Weighting</strong>  The strength of a signal related to a given instrument is ignored except insofar as the signal is strong enough to be worthy of a position at all. Different from equal position weighting, unequal weighting assumes implicitly that there is sufficient statistical strength and power to predict not only the direction of a position in the future but also the magnitude and/or probability of its move relative to the other forecasts in the portfolio. Quants utilizing equal-weighting schemes believe that  the alpha model is only to be trusted enough to forecast direction, and as long as there is sufficient confidence in a forecast of direction that is sufficiently large to justify trading the instrument at all, it is worth trading at the same size as any other position. Meanwhile, unequal weighting leads to a willingness to take a few large bets on the best forecasts and many smaller bets on the less dramatic forecasts. This weighting disparity may lead to the strategy taking excess risk of some idiosyncratic event in a seemingly attractive position. This can be the case regardless of the type of alpha used to make a forecast. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In momentum-oriented strategies, many of the strongest signals are those for which the underlying instrument has already moved the most. In other words, it might be too late, and the trader risks getting his strongest signals at the peak of the trend, just as it reverses. Similarly, for mean reversion-oriented strategies, many of the largest signals are also for those instruments that have already moved the most and are now expected to snap back aggressively. But frequently, large moves happen because there is real information in the marketplace that leads to a prolonged or extended trend. This phenomenon is known to statisticians as adverse selection bias.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are occasions in which bad data points end up filtering into a trading strategy. Equal weighting positions, in particular if there are many of them, ensure that the risk of loss associated with the large forecasts that could result from significantly wrong data does not get out of hand. </p>
<p><strong>Equal Risk Weighting</strong> Equal risk weighting adjusts position sizes inversely to their volatilities (or whatevr other measure of risk, such as drawdown, is preferred). The rationale is straightforward. A small-cap stock with a significant amount of price volatility might not deserve quite the same allocation as a mega cap stock with substantially less volatility. Putting an equal number of dollars into these two positions might in fact be taking a much larger and inadvertent real bet on the small cap stock. This is because the small cap stock is much more volatile, and therefore every dollar allocated to that stock would move the portfolio more than the same dollars allocated to the larger cap position. As such, some quants who believe that equal weighting is the most appropriate method will utilize an equal risk-weighting approach in an effort to improve the true diversification achieved. However, the equal risk-weighting approach also has its shortcomings: volatility is  a backward-looking measurement, lower-volatility instruments might suddenly become volatile. </p>
<p><strong>Alpha-Driven Weighting</strong> The idea behind alpha-driven weighting position is that the alpha model dictates how attractive a position is likely to be, and this signal is the best way to size the position correctly. Still, most quants who utilize this approach would not allow the size of the largest position to be unlimited. As such, they would use the risk model to provide a maximum size limit for a single position. Given the limit, the strength of the signal determines how close to the maximum the position can actually be. The types of constraints used with this approach to portfolio construction can also include limits on the size of the total bet on a group (e.g., sector or asset class). There still needs to be a function that relates the magnitude of the forecast to the size of the position, but these functions can be straightforward, and in general, the bigger the forecast, the larger the position. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alpha weighting is favored by some quants because it emphasizes making money, which is after all the goal of the whole exercise. However, some quant strategies, such as futures trend following, that utilize this method can suffer sharp drawdowns relatively frequently. This is because these models usually have the largest signals when a price trend is already well established. As the trend proceeds, the size of the position grows, but this will often leave the trader with his largest position just when the trend reverses. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Caution is therefore advisable when utilizing an alpha-driven portfolio construction algorithm, because such an approach causes a heavy reliance on the alpha model being right â€” not only about its forecast of the direction of an instrument but also about the size of the move the instrument will make. </p>
<p><strong>Decision-tree weighting</strong> Decision-tree approaches  look at a defined set of rules in a particular order to determine position sizing. </p>
<h2 id="Portfolio-Optimizers"><a href="#Portfolio-Optimizers" class="headerlink" title="Portfolio Optimizers"></a>Portfolio Optimizers</h2><p>Portfolio optimizers are based on the principles of <em>modern portfolio theory</em> (MPT): investors are inherently risk averse. If two assets offer the same return but different levels of risk, investors will prefer the less risky asset. The objective function that many quants use is the same as the original: maximizing the return of a portfolio relative to the volatility of the portfolioâ€™s returns. However, an infinite array of objective functions can be used. For example, one could specify an objective function that will cause the optimizer to maximize portfolio return relative to peak-to-valley drawdown instead of return volatility. The use of return versus risk is itself entirely optional, and one could very easily optimize an objective function focused entirely on the total expected return of a portfolio. </p>
<h3 id="Inputs-to-optimization"><a href="#Inputs-to-optimization" class="headerlink" title="Inputs to optimization"></a>Inputs to optimization</h3><p>The inputs required for an optimizer, as already mentioned, are </p>
<blockquote>
<p>expected returns<br>expected volatility<br>expected correlation </p>
</blockquote>
<p>of the various instruments to be considered for the portfolio. It is worth understanding where practitioners get the estimates and expectations used in optimization, since they are critical to the model itself. </p>
<p><strong>Expected Return</strong>  In more traditional finance, such as private wealth management, expected returns are usually set to equal very long-term historical returns because usually the goal is to create a strategic asset allocation that wonâ€™t need to be dynamically readjusted. <strong>By contrast, quants tend to use their alpha models to drive expected return.</strong> The output of the alpha model typically includes an expected return and/or an expected direction, or some other output that indicates the attractiveness of each potential portfolio holding (e.g., a score). </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Forecasts of direction can be used as forecasts of return simply by making all positive forecasts equal and all negative forecasts equal (often subject to minimum threshold parameters, so that at least the return forecasts have to be of some significant size before making a bet). In this kind of optimization, it is not important to have a precise forecast of return, but rather a forecast of the attractiveness of each potential position in terms of the expected return. So directional forecasts are indifferent between the expected return of each position, and the only relevant feature of the forecast is its sign. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Expected Volatility</strong> Many practitioners, whether in traditional finance or in quant trading, tend to use historical measures for volatility. Some, however, develop and use their own forecasts of volatility.  The most common approaches to forecasting volatility utilize stochastic volatility models. The basic idea behind the stochastic family of volatility forecasting methods is that volatility goes through phases in which it is at high levels, followed by periods in which it is at low levels (i.e., the somewhat predictable phases of the volatility cycle), with occasional jumps (the somewhat random and unpredictable part). The most widely used such technique is called Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH). Indeed, there exist many other approaches to forecasting volatility, and they can be understood in much the same way that we evaluated strategies for forecasting price. </p>
<p><strong>Expected Correlation</strong>  Correlation is at heart a measure of the similarity of the movements of two instruments, expressed in a number between -1 and +1. An interesting fact about correlation is that it says nothing about the trend in the instruments over time. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine two companies in the same industry group, such as airline companies. If the first company is simply outcompeting the other and winning market share, the first will ikely have a positive trendline, while the second may well have a negative trendline (assuming the overall market is roughly flat). Nevertheless, these two companies will likely have a high positive correlation, because their  returns are still driven heavily by the overall market, by their sector, and by their industry, not to mention the more specific market factors associated with being an airline company (e.g., the price of oil). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a number of problems with using standard correlation measures in quant trading. For example, the measurement of the relationships between two instruments can be very unstable over time. They can even be unreliable over long time periods. The main source of this instability is that the relationships between financial instruments are often governed by a variety of dynamic forces. For example, if the stock market is experiencing a significant downdraft, it is probable that the correlation between A and B will be temporarily higher than usual. If, on the other hand, there is uncertainty about oil supply, this may affect A but not B, and correlation may be reduced temporarily. If either company has significant news, this can cause decoupling as well. </p>
<h3 id="Optimization-Techniques"><a href="#Optimization-Techniques" class="headerlink" title="Optimization Techniques"></a>Optimization Techniques</h3><p>There are many types of optimizers, ranging from basic copies of Markowitzâ€™s original specification in 1952 to sophisticated machine learning techniques: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unconstrained Optimization<br>Constrained Optimization<br>Black-Litterman Optimization<br>Grinold and Kahnâ€™s Approach: Optimizing Factor Portfolios<br>Resampled Efficiency<br>Data-Mining Approaches to Optimization</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Black-Litterman Optimization</strong> Fischer Black, of Black-Scholes fame, and Bob Litterman, of Goldman Sachs, in 1990 produced a new optimization method that was first introduced in an internal memo at Goldman but was later published in 1992 in the <em>Financial Analysts Journal</em>. The <em>Black-Litterman optimizer</em> addresses some of the problems associated with errors in the measurement of inputs to an optimizer. Most important, they proposed a method of blending an investorâ€™s expectations with a degree of confidence about those expectations, and these with the historical precedent evident in the data. </p>
<blockquote>
<p> Imagine that A and B correlate at 0.7 historically, but going forward, a traderâ€™s alpha model forecasts that A will rally while B will fall. In this case, the correlation between A and B over the period being forecast may be quite low, perhaps even negative, despite the evidence from history. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Black-Litterman provided a way to adjust historically observed correlation levels by utilizing the investorâ€™s forecasts of return for the various instruments in questions. Furthermore, to the extent that the investor has greater confidence in some forecasts and less in others, this fact can be incorporated. If the investor forecast significant divergence between instruments that historically have correlated at a high level but has a low level of confidence in the forecast, something much closer to the historical level of correlation is used. To the extent that the investor has greater confidence, the forecast returns play a more important role in determining the correlation coefficient utilized by the Black-Litterman optimizer. Some quants prefer this method of optimization because it allows for a more holistic approach to combining the alpha model with the other inputs to optimization. </p>
<p><strong>Grinold and Kahnâ€™s Approach: Optimizing Factor Portfolios</strong> This kind of portfolio optimization technique is directly aimed at building a portfolio of signals. The idea of this approach is to build <em>factor portfolios</em>, each of which is usually rule-based (in fact, very often equal-weighted or equal risk-weighted) portfolios based on a single type of alpha forecast.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One could imagine building a momentum portfolio, a value portfolio, and a growth portfolio.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each of these portfolios is in turn simulated historically, as though it were making stock picks through the past. In this way, a time series of the returns of these simulated factor portfolios is generated. These simulated factor portfolio returns are then treated as the instruments of a portfolio by the optimizer. What is therefore being optimized is not a portfolio of thousands of instruments but rather the mixing of a handful of factor portfolios.  Given the weight of each model, we can  ultimately obtain  the weight of each position. </p>
<p><strong>Resampled Efficiency</strong> Intend to produce more robust predictions than are possible from simply using only the actual sequence of returns the instrument exhibited using a technique called <em>Monte Carlo simulation</em>. A Monte Carlo simulation reorders the actually observed results many times, thereby creating a large number of time series all based on the same underlying observations. Interesting, the average return and the volatility of returns will remain the same across all these alternate histories because they are based on the same underlying return distribution. A word of warning regarding such resampling techniques is: Re-using a historical distribution is only really useful is you have sufficient confidence that the sample in the historical distribution is a fair representation of the whole population. </p>
<p><strong>Data-Mining Approaches to Optimization</strong> Do the same thing with mean variance optimization: searching many possible portfolios and attempting to find the ones that exhibite the best characteristics, as specified by the objective function of the optimizer. </p>
<h3 id="Output-of-Portfolio-Construction-Models"><a href="#Output-of-Portfolio-Construction-Models" class="headerlink" title="Output of Portfolio Construction Models"></a>Output of Portfolio Construction Models</h3><p> Regardless of the type of portfolio construction approach used, the output of the quantitative portfolio construction model is a targeted portfolio: the desirable individual positions and the targeted sizes of each. This target portfolio is compared to the current portfolio, and the differences are the trades that need to be done. In the case that a brand-new portfolio is being built from scratch, all the positions recommented by the portfolio construction model will need to be executed. If, instead, the quant is rerunning the portfolio construction model as he would do periodically in the normal course of business, he would need to do only the incremental trades that close the gap between the newly recommended portfolio and the existing portfolio he holds. </p>

            <blockquote>
<p>The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent â€” John Maynard Keynes </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Risk management should not be thought of solely as the avoidance of risk or reduction of loss. It is about the intentional selection and sizing of exposures to improve the quality and consistency of returns.   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Relative alpha strategy: value/yield<br><strong>Risk</strong>: Cheap (Higher-yield) stocks underperform expensive (lower-yield) stocks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The risk is inherent to the pursuit of a value strategy, even if the quant has reason to believe that value strategies should make money in the long term. However, <strong>a value strategy without further specification can end up taking significant sector bets in addition to the intentional bet on value. But there is no evidence that there exists a long-term benefit of overweighting one industry or sector versus another.</strong> More important, assume that the stratey has neither the intention nor the capability to forecast the performance of various sectors. Therefore, sector exposure would be considered a form of risk in our framework, because sector performance is not being intentionally forecast, but having net exposure to various sectors can alter the strategyâ€™s results day to day. <strong>So the key to understanding risk exposures as they related to quant trading strategies is that risk exposures are those that are not intentionally sought out by the nature of whatever forecast the quant is making in the alpha model</strong>.    If alpha models are like optimists, risk models are like pessimists. Risk models exist largely to control the size of desirable exposures or to deal with undesirable types of exposures. Their job is to raise hell about things that can cause losses or uncertainty, particularly those bets that are unintentionally made or are incidental byproducts of the alpha model. Risk models both highlight and attempt to remove undersirable exposures from a portfolio. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are, however, only a few things you can do with a given type of exposure, aside from simply accepting it outright. Mostly you can limit its size or eliminate it altogether. The function of risk management in the investment process is to determine which of these courses of action is most prudent for each kind of exposure and to provide that input to the portfolio construction model. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Limiting-the-Amount-of-Risk"><a href="#Limiting-the-Amount-of-Risk" class="headerlink" title="Limiting the Amount of Risk"></a>Limiting the Amount of Risk</h2><blockquote>
<p>How risk is measured? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are two generally accepted ways of measuring the amount of risk in the marketplace: <em>volatility</em> and <em>dispersion</em>.  Volatility is longitudinal and measures risk by computing the standard deviation of the returns of various instruments over time, which is a way of getting at the concept of uncertainty. Dispersion measures the level of similarity in the behavior of the various instruments within a given investment universe. This is frequently calculated by taking the <strong>cross-sectional</strong> standard deviation of all the relevant instruments for a given period. The larger the standard deviation, the more varied the underlying instruments are behaving. This means that the market is less risky because the portfolio can be made of a larger number of diversified bets. Dispersion can also be measured by the correlation or covariance among the instruments in a given universe. There are many other approaches to measuring risk as well: credit spreads or credit default swaps, or the use of implied volatilities. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The manner in which size is limited. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Size-limiting models can be used to govern many kinds of exposures. One can limit the size of single positions and/or groups of positions, such as sectors or asset classes. Alternatively, one can limit the size of exposure to various types of risks. For example, in equity trading, one can limit the exposure of a model to market bets or to market capitalization bets. <strong>In general, risks that are subjected to limits or penalties are those that are not being forecast explicitly by the alpha model.</strong>  Another component of a risk model may be to govern the amount of <strong>overall portfolio leverage</strong>. The most common tool used for this purpose is known as a <em>value at risk</em> (VaR) model.  The way that this model controls risk in the face of rising volatility is to reduce leverage.  One issue bears mentioning is that volatility isnâ€™t a constant over time. If a quant is goof at forecasting volatility or dispersion, there are far more interesting and productive ways to utilize these forecasts (for example, in the options markets) than there are in a risk model that governs leverage. A more theoretically sound approach, though substantially harder to implement practically, seeks to increase leverage when the strategy has better odds of winning and to decrease risk when the strategy has worse odds. The trick is to know when the odds are on oneâ€™s side. Some quants solve this problem by allowing the level of leverage to vary with the overall strength and certainty of the predictions from the alpha model, which seems to be a reasonable approach. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is having its size limited? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Approaches to the size limits come in two main forms: hard constraints and penalties. The levels of limits and/or penalties can be determined in the same ways as most other things in the quant world, namely either from theory or from the data. Theory-driven approaches mostly look like an arbitrary level that is set, tested, and, if needed, adjusted until it produces an acceptable outcomes. Data-driven approaches are more varied and can include machine learning techniques to test many combinations of limits or simply testing various limit levels and letting the historical data empirically determine the final outcome. </p>
<h2 id="Limiting-the-Types-of-Risk"><a href="#Limiting-the-Types-of-Risk" class="headerlink" title="Limiting the Types of Risk"></a>Limiting the Types of Risk</h2><p>Revisiting an earlier  relative alpha strategy, the quant might not believe he has a valid way to forecast the returns of the sectors to which these equities belong. In this case, the quant may design his bet structures so that he is making forecasts of stocksâ€™ returns <em>relative</em> to their sectorâ€™s returns, which means that he never has a bet on the direction of the sector itself (since there should be no expectation of being compensated sufficiently for accepting them), only on which stocks will outperform and which stocks will underperform the sector.  This, in turn, helps him eliminate sector bets, which is clearly a risk management exercise as much as it is alpha generation. As such, it is theoretically possible to incorporate all the needed components of his risk model fully into his alpha model by specifying the alpha model such that it <strong>only forecasts exactly the exposures from which it expects to make money and structures its bets to avoid exposure to nonforecasted factors</strong>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Theory-Driven Risk Models</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Theory-driven risk modeling typically focuses on named or <em>systematic</em> risk factors. Just as in the case of theory-driven alpha models, systematic risks that are derived from theory are those for which the quant can make a reasonable, economic argument. Theory-driven risk modeling uses a set of <strong>predefined systematic risks</strong>, which enables the quant to measure and calibrate a given portfolioâ€™s exposures (systematic risks are those that cannot be diversified away: market, sector, market capitalization, et.al). </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Empirical Risk Models </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Empirical risk models are based on the same premise as theory-driven models, namely that systematic risks should be measured and mitigated. However, the empirical approach <strong>uses historical data to determine what these risks are and how exposed a given portfolio is to them</strong>. Using statistical techniques such as <strong>principal component analysis (PCA)</strong>, a quant is able to use historical data to discern systematic risk factors.  These statistical risk models are most commonly found among statistical arbitrage traders, who are betting on exactly that component of an individual stockâ€™s returns that is not explained by systematic risks.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is important to note that such statistical methods may discover entirely new systematic risk factors, which a reasonable observer might be inclined to acknowledge exist but for which names have not been assigned. On the other hand, statistical risk models are subject to being fooled by the data into finding a risk factor that will not persist for any useful amount of time into the future. It is also possible for a statistical risk model to find spurious exposures, which are just coincidences and not indicative of any real risk in the marketplace. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Quants are attracted to theory-driven risk models because the risk factors they encapsulate make sense. Quants that choose empirical risk models typically seek the benefits of adaptiveness. Theoretical risk models are relatively rigid, meaning that the risk factors are not altered often (otherwise the thoery would not have been very strong in the first place). Yet the factors that drive markets do change over time. As markets evolve, the data that the markets produce reflect this evolution, and these data drive empirical risk models. For these reasons, an empirical model may be more adaptive to ever-changing market conditions by detecting through new data whatever factors are implicitly driving markets. There are two stages to this adaptation. </p>
<div id="flowchart-0" class="flow-chart"></div>

<p>Besides exhibiting a weakness during a regime change, a basic understanding of statistics reveals another problem with empirical risk models. To achieve statistical significance and reduce the potential for measurement error in computing relationships among various instruments, empirical risk models require a rather large amount of data. But this leads to a trade-off that could squelch most of the adaptiveness benefits of empirical risk model, which would be addressed, somehow, by using intraday data.<br>It is worth noting that these two kinds of risk models are not mutually exclusive.  Managers might use their judgement and discretion to monitor market behavior and, should it become clear to them that theire is a new risk factor that is driving markets, they build a made-to-order risk factor to measure this temporary phenomenon. When they see that the new driver has faded in importance, they can remove it from the risk model, again using their judgment. </p>
<blockquote>
<p> If the theoretical risk models are any good at being right, an empirical model should capture these effects without having to know the names of the factors beforehand. If market risk is indeed a big driver of stock prices, an empirical model should pick this up from the data. If the data donâ€™t bear it out, what good is the theory? Most premade risk models, e.g., BARRA, Northfield, Axioma, and Quantal, are not of the empirical variety because empirical solutions require a specifically set universe of instruments, and the analytical techniques are usually relatively easy to implement with simple price data. </p>

<p> Prediction is very difficult, especially about the future  â€” Niels Bohr</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Alpha-Models"><a href="#Alpha-Models" class="headerlink" title="Alpha Models"></a>Alpha Models</h2><p>Alpha is used as a way to quantify the skill of an investor or the return she delivers independently of the moves in the broader market. Alpha models are merely a systematic approach to adding skill (in timing the selection and/or sizing of portfolio holdings) to the investment process in order to make profits. For example, a trend-following traderâ€™s ability to systematically identify trends that will persist into the future represents one type of skill that can generate profits.   All successful alpha models are designed to have some edge, which allows them to anticipate the future with enough accuracy that, after allowing for being wrong at least sometimes and for the cost of trading, they can still make money. In a sense, of the various parts of a quant strategy, the alpha model is the optimist, focused on making money by predicting the future. </p>
<h3 id="Types-of-Alpha-Models-Theory-Driven-and-Data-Driven"><a href="#Types-of-Alpha-Models-Theory-Driven-and-Data-Driven" class="headerlink" title="Types of Alpha Models: Theory-Driven and Data Driven"></a>Types of Alpha Models: Theory-Driven and Data Driven</h3><p>Theoretical scientists try to make sense of the world around them by hypothesizing why it is the way it is. They start with observations of the markets, think of a generalized theory that could explain the observed begavior, and then rigorously test it with market data to see if the teory is shown to be either unture or supported by the outcome of the test. </p>
<p>Empirical scientists believe that enough observations of the world can allow them to predict future patterns of behavior, even if there is no hypothesis to rationalize the behavior in an intuitive way. </p>
<h4 id="Theory-Driven-Alpha-Models"><a href="#Theory-Driven-Alpha-Models" class="headerlink" title="Theory-Driven Alpha Models"></a>Theory-Driven Alpha Models</h4><p>Most of what theory-driven quants do can be relatively easily fit into one of six classes of phenomena: trend, reversion, technical sentiment, value/yield, growth, and quality. These six categories can be further understood by examining the data that they use: price-related data and fundamental data. </p>
<ul>
<li>price-related data: trend, mean reversion, technical sentiment </li>
<li>fundamental data: value/yield, growth/sentiment, quality </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Trend Following</strong>  Trend followers typically look for a significant  move in a given direction in an instrument. They bet that, once a significant move has occurred, it will persist because this significant move is a likely sign of a growing consensus. There are many ways to defining what kind of move is significant, and the most common terms used to describe this act of definition are <code>filtering</code> and <code>conditioning</code>, e.g., only if the volumes that were associated with the price movements were significant, whereas a low-volume trend might be ignored.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example:  CTA<br><strong>Risk</strong>: The returns of this strategy are streaky and highly variable<br><strong>Idea</strong>: Make enough money in the good times and manage the downside well enough in the bad times to make the whole exercise worthwhile</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mean Reversion</strong> Mean reversion traders must identify the current mean or equilibrium and then must determine what amount of divergence from that equilibrium is sufficient to warrant a trade.  Interesting, trend and mean reversion strategies are not necessarily at odds with each other. Longer-term trends can occur, even as smaller oscillations around these trends occur in the shorter term.  In fact, some quants use both of these strategies in conjunction. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: stat arbï¼š<br><strong>Risk</strong>: Any time that the market regime changes, the relationships among instruments frequently also change, which can lead the system to mistakenly group things together, even though they no longer will behave like each other<br><strong>Idea</strong>: Relative attractiveness analysis </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Technical Sentiment</strong>  An indicator of future returns. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong>: Look at the volume of puts and calls. If puts have higher volumes r.t. calls than they normally do, it might be an indicator that investors are worrried about a downturn.<br><strong>Example 2</strong>: Implied vols of puts vs calls.<br><strong>Example 3</strong>: Shape of limit order book (Short-term); trading volume, turnover (Long-term).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Value/Yield</strong> There are many metrics that people use to describe value in various asset classes, but most of them end up being ratios of some fundamental factor versus the price of the instrument,  e.g., E/P ratio.  Value investing is often done on a relative basis: buying the undervalued security and selling the overvalued one against it, this strategy is also known as a <code>carry trade</code> in currencies and bonds, and <code>quant long/short</code> in equities.  </p>
<p><strong>Growth/Sentiment &amp; Quality</strong>  Similar to Value/Yield Strategy except for the indicators used. </p>
<h4 id="Data-Driven-Alpha-Models"><a href="#Data-Driven-Alpha-Models" class="headerlink" title="Data-Driven Alpha Models"></a>Data-Driven Alpha Models</h4><p>These strategies look at current market conditions, searching the history for similar conditions, detemining the probabilities of various outcomes in the aftermath of that setup, and making trades in accordance with the probabilities.  Many HFTs favor an entirely empirical, data-mining approach when designing their short-term trading strategies. </p>
<h2 id="Implementing-the-Strategies"><a href="#Implementing-the-Strategies" class="headerlink" title="Implementing the Strategies"></a>Implementing the Strategies</h2><p>There are not many ways for alpha-focused traders to make money. But the limited selection of sources of alpha does not imply that all quants choose one of a handful of phenomena and then have a peer group to which they are substantively identical. There is in fact considerable diversity among alpha traders. This diversity stems from the way quants implement their strategies, including </p>
<blockquote>
<p> forecast target<br>time horizon<br>bet structure<br>investment universe<br>model specification<br>run frequency</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Forecast target can be the direction, magnitude, and/or duration of a move and furthermore can include an assignment of confidence or probability for their forecast.  Time horizon can be high-frequency (no further than the end of the current trading day), short-term (one day to two weeks), medium-term (a few weeks to a few months) and long-term (several months or longer).  Bet structure can be made to forecast either an instrument in itself or an instrument relative to others (e.g., pairs or sectors). A given strategy can be implemented in a variety of instruments, and the quant can choose which ones to include or exclude according to geography, asset class, insturement class, liquidity, predictable e.t., al.   Moreover, there could be multiple ways for quants to define a trend, and determine the run frequency. </p>
<h2 id="Blending-Alpha-Models"><a href="#Blending-Alpha-Models" class="headerlink" title="Blending Alpha Models"></a>Blending Alpha Models</h2><p>Each of the decisions a quant makes in defining a trading strategy is an important driver of its behavior. The quant is not limited to choosing just one approach to a given alpha model. Instead, he is equally free to choose to employ multiple types of alpha models. The method used to combine these alpha models is an arena rich with possibilities. The most sophisticated and successful quants tend to utilize several kinds of alpha strategies, including trend and reversion, and various kinds of fundamental approaches across a variety of time horizons, trade structures, instruments, and geographies. Such quants benefit from alpha diversification in exactly the same way that diversification is helpful in so many other aspects of financial life.  The three most common quant approaches to blending forecasts are via linear models, nonlinear models (conditioning, filtering) and machine learning models. A siginificant fourth school of thought believes that alpha models should not be combined at all. Instead, several portfolios are constructed, each based on the output from a given alpha model. These factor portfolios are then combined using any of the portfolio construction techniques.  Each of these four approaches to signal mixing has its disciples, and the best way to blend alphas depends on the model itself. </p>
